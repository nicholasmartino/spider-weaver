Feature: Urban Space Dynamics Prediction # features/model_training.feature:3

  Background:   # features/model_training.feature:10

  Scenario: Exporting maps to external path                                                         # features/model_training.feature:27
    Given a dataset of georeferenced parcel geometries within the Metro Vancouver Regional District # features/steps/model_training_steps.py:15
    Given a predictive model trained                                                                # features/steps/model_training_steps.py:68
    Then plot maps of 6 most important variables                                                    # features/steps/model_training_steps.py:101
    And copy outputs to manuscript path                                                             # features/steps/model_training_steps.py:157
