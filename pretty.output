  Scenario Outline: Training a predictive model with spatial data -- @1.1                                            # features/model_training.feature:19
    Given a dataset of georeferenced geometries within Metro Vancouver Regional District                             # features/steps/model_training_steps.py:58
    When the dataset includes valid quantitative and georeferenced data                                              # features/steps/model_training_steps.py:76
