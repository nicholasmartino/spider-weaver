Feature: Urban Space Dynamics Prediction # features/model_training.feature:3
  As an urban researcher,
  I want to use georeferenced data to train a predictive model,
  So that I can accurately predict key indicators related to walkability and affordability in urban areas,
  And identify spatial indicators that significantly influence these dynamics.
  Background:   # features/model_training.feature:10

  Scenario: Predicting dependent variables with a trained model                                     # features/model_training.feature:22
    Given a dataset of georeferenced parcel geometries within the Metro Vancouver Regional District # features/steps/model_training_steps.py:13
    Given a predictive model trained                                                                # features/steps/model_training_steps.py:65
    Then assess predictive accuracy based on the test data                                          # features/steps/model_training_steps.py:77
    And rank explanatory variables by permutation importance                                        # features/steps/model_training_steps.py:86
