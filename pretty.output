Feature: Spatial Metrics for City of Vancouver # features/2_measure.feature:3
  As an urban researcher,
  I want to spatially aggregate georeferenced data sources to property parcels
  So that I can train a predictive model.
  Background:   # features/2_measure.feature:9

  Scenario Outline: Aggregate from Data Source to Sample Along Street Network -- @1.1                               # features/2_measure.feature:20
    Given craigslist/housing_rent data located within Metro Vancouver Regional District                             # features/steps/2_measure.py:15
    Given open_street_map/gps_walk data located within Metro Vancouver Regional District                            # features/steps/2_measure.py:15
    When the geometry data of open_street_map/gps_walk is valid                                                     # features/steps/2_measure.py:38
    And count is available in the open_street_map/gps_walk data                                                     # features/steps/2_measure.py:45
    Then sum the count (walkability) within 1600 meters from open_street_map/gps_walk to samples via street network # features/steps/2_measure.py:63
