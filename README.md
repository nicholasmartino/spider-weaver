## Predictive Urban Network Analysis

Spider weaver is a high level repository to enable data aggregation using network analysis in urban environments.

The code in the repo was used to gather and preprocess data from open data sources, aggregate metrics on a sample layer across networks and finally train and assess a [RandomForestRegressor](https://scikit-learn.org/1.5/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor.html#sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestRegressor) model to predict defined explanatory variables. BDD-style tests were developed to organize the workflow and set parameters for data processing and analysis.
